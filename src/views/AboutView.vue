      building a platform capable of fetching and integrating data from various sources. The
      research methodology combines literature reviews, qualitative interviews, and technical
      prototyping to provide a comprehensive analysis. The ultimate aim is to create a prototype and
      establish a set of guidelines that could act as a foundation for future developments in this
      area.
